# p5JS_Game with Q-Learning
This is a simple JavaScript game developed using the p5.js library, which integrates Q-learning for the playerâ€™s movement decision-making. The game consists of a player-controlled object that moves left and right to collect yellow stars (rewards) while avoiding falling red bombs (penalties). The game uses the Bellman equation in its Q-learning algorithm to determine the best course of action for the player.

## Game Description
In this game:

The player can move left or right to avoid falling red bombs and collect yellow stars.
Each yellow star collected increases the score, while being hit by a red bomb ends the game.
The player's movement is controlled by a Q-learning agent that learns over time to maximize its score by collecting stars and avoiding bombs..

## Q-Learning Algorithm
Bellman Equation in Use
The Q-learning algorithm is implemented in the game to help the player "learn" the best way to move. The key concept behind Q-learning is the Bellman equation, which is used to update the Q-values based on the agent's experiences.

The Bellman equation helps us evaluate how good an action is in a particular state, considering both the immediate reward and the potential future rewards. The equation used is as follows:
